# HUMINT Overview

**HUMINT (Human Intelligence)** refers to intelligence gathered through direct human interaction, such as interviews, observation, and interpersonal communication. Unlike technical intelligence (e.g., SIGINT or IMINT), HUMINT relies on people as both sources and collectors of information.

## What is HUMINT?

HUMINT involves collecting information through direct contact with individuals. It can be:
- **Overt:** Interviews, debriefings, diplomatic reporting
- **Covert:** Espionage, clandestine surveillance

## Everyday Examples of HUMINT

HUMINT isn't limited to espionageâ€”it appears in many civilian and professional settings:

- **Law Enforcement:** Police interviewing witnesses or suspects.
- **Business Intelligence:** Gathering market data through conversations at events.
- **Traveler Debriefings:** Agencies debriefing returning travelers.
- **Military Patrols:** Soldiers gathering info from local populations.
- **Cybersecurity:** Engaging in forums to learn about cyber threats.
- **Everyday Life:** A friend or a family member asking about someone.

## Civilian Examples

- **Job Networking:** Asking for job leads and insider knowledge.
- **Market Research:** Talking to customers/competitors at trade shows.
- **Journalism:** Interviewing sources for news stories.
- **Community Policing:** Officers gathering local intel from residents.
- **Social Engineering:** Using manipulation to extract sensitive data.

## RUMINT vs HUMINT

### RUMINT (Rumor Intelligence)

| Pros                                | Cons                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Early warnings and hidden leads     | [Unverified and easily manipulated](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/blob/main/smokescreen-misinfo.md)               |
| Gauges public sentiment             | May waste resources or damage credibility       |

### HUMINT (Human Intelligence)

| Pros                                | Cons                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| In-depth and contextual             | Relies heavily on source credibility            |
| Flexible and adaptable              | Vulnerable to deception and operational risks   |
