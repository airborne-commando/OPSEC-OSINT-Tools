## (Operations Security) is a systematic process for:
1. Identifying
2. Protecting and controlling critical information

It's a security discipline and operations function that involves a continuous cycle of:
* Identifying critical information and indicators (CII)
  * Critical information and indicators are essential components of Operations Security aimed at protecting sensitive data that could be exploited by adversaries. Critical Information includes unclassified or controlled unclassified information about activities, intentions, capabilities, or limitations that adversaries can use to gain an advantage. Indicators are observable actions or pieces of information that reveal critical details about operations, such as sudden changes in procedures or increased security measures. Protecting this information involves identifying vulnerabilities and implementing countermeasures to prevent unauthorized disclosure
* Analyzing potential threats and vulnerabilities
* Assessing risks
* Developing countermeasures to protect CII

 is used to protect information and activities from adversaries. It helps identify and protect sensitive information that could give an adversary an advantage. OPSEC principles can be applied in daily life, such as not sharing personal information like a DOB, street address, email, phone number.

**Examples of OPSEC mistakes include:**
* Over-sharing personal information online
   * [Chris Chan](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLABqEYq6H3vpCmsmyUnHnfMOeAnjBdSNm)
   * [suspectAGB](https://opsecfail.github.io/blog.html?filecase=suspectAGB)

* Leaving unused social media online
* interacting with a target on social media
   * [w0rmer](https://opsecfail.github.io/blog.html?filecase=w0rmer)
   * [darknetdiaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/63/)

* [examples of good and bad opsec and some osint.](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/blob/main/examples.md)

OPSEC supplements other security disciplines rather than replacing them.

### How to OPSEC:

* **Use services that can conceal your identity:**

### **Key Takeaways**  
1. **Messaging**:  
   - **Signal** OR **Simplex** > **Telegram** for privacy.  

   - Remember: E2E ≠ total anonymity (metadata leaks/habits matter).


2. **Anonymity**:  
   - **Tor** + **Mullvad VPN** + **XMR** = layered protection.  
   - Avoid logging into personal accounts while using these tools.
   - Pitfalls: you need to use TOR and Mullvad separately for maximum Anonymity, use a [Virtual Machine](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/blob/main/opsec.md#virtualization) for VPN's and TOR on another (or the host).

3. **Identity**:  
   - **Unique usernames** + **AI faces** + **word spinning** = harder to trace.  

4. **Self-Audit**:  
   - Regularly **opt out** of data brokers and **OSINT yourself**.  

5. **OPSEC Mindset**:  
   - Follow **[good OPSEC](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/blob/main/good-opsec.md)** and avoid **[bad habits](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/blob/main/badopsec.md)**.


**Note**:

By TOR I mean Tor Browser, VPN as in Virtual Private Network (Mullvad; though it can be other types of VPN's out there as long as it's safe to use and vetted by privacy experts); XMR is Monero Coin or Monero for short, a Privacy Coin.

Check Wikipedia If you're confused on all of these here:
1. [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)
   - [VPN service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VPN_service)
2. [TOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network))
3. [XMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monero)

### **Pro Tips**  
- **Signal Workaround**: Use a burner phone number (e.g., Google Voice) for registration.    
- **Monero Mining**: Run a local node to avoid centralized exchanges tracing purchases.

## Smoke Screen and misinfo

A smoke screen operation in the context of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) refers to deliberate actions taken to obscure, mislead, or mask the true activities, intentions, or identities of individuals or organizations from those conducting open-source intelligence gathering. The term is borrowed from military tactics, where a smoke screen is used to conceal movements or positions from enemy observation. In cyber and intelligence contexts, the concept is adapted to digital and informational environments. You may read more [here](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/blob/main/smokescreen-misinfo.md).

## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

**<div align="center">What is it, how is this used and why is it important:</div>**

- OSINT is the practice of collecting and analyzing information from public sources to address specific intelligence needs. OSINT is used by government agencies and commercial organizations for various purposes, including:

  - Reconnaissance
  - Cyber crime investigations
  - Market trend analysis
  - Brand positioning analysis
  - Measuring risk to an organization
  - Understanding the actor, tactics, and targets
  - Gather real-time information
  - Make informed decisions
  - Receive early warnings of potential threats

## Who uses Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)?

- National Security and Intelligence Agencies, Law Enforcement, Businesses, Cybersecurity and Cyber-crime Groups, Privacy-Conscious People, Non-Governmental Organizations

  - The CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) all use OSINT.
  - OSINT can protect citizens (private or otherwise) from identity theft, sexual violence, and abuse.
  - OSINT can monitor competitors, investigate new markets, and plan marketing activities.
  - OSINT can gather intelligence about specific targets online.
  - OSINT can check how outsiders can break into their computing devices.
  - OSINT can be used on oneself to secure privacy.
  - Bellingcat, the Center for Information Resilience, and Oryx use OSINT.
  - And you! Yes, you can use OSINT.

## Sources of OSINT
OSINT can gather information from various sources, including:
- [Public government data](https://www.opendatasoft.com/en/glossary/public-data/)

  - Public data refers to all information made freely available by government bodies or local collectivities. This data is in the public domain. It is different to open data, which is a subset of public data. Open data is structured and well-maintained data that is therefore easier to understand, access and consume. By contrast public data can be difficult to find, or (in the case of public bodies), require the submission of a Freedom of Information Act to retrieve it.

- [Professional and academic publications](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/academic-publication)

  - Academic Publication means the publication of an abstract, article or paper in a journal or electronic repository, or its presentation at a conference or seminar.


- [Commercial data](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/commercial-data)

  - Commercial Data means any and all data and information relating to an identified or identifiable Person (whether the information is accurate or not), alone or in combination with other information, which Person is or was an actual or prospective customer of, or consumer of products offered by, the VS Business or L Brands Business, as applicable.

  - Commercial Data means any and all data and information relating to an identified or identifiable Person (whether the information is accurate or not), alone or in combination with other information, which Person is or was an actual or prospective customer of, or consumer of products or services offered by, the LoyaltyOne Business and/or ADS Business, as applicable.

  - Commercial Data means any and all data collected or otherwise processed by the Seller Entities relating to a customer of the Business.

- [Grey literature](https://browse.welch.jhmi.edu/c.php?g=1195274)

  - Grey literature is "Information produced on all levels of government, academics, business and industry in electronic and print formats not controlled by commercial publishing i.e. where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body."
   
  - Grey literature can be useful for your research, but finding resources requires different tactics than you'd use for commercially published materials. This is because many types of grey literature are not indexed in some of the more common research tools like PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, etc. 

### Real world examples of OSINT

## In the year 2016, a basket weaving image board used OSINT to pay some supposed terrorist a vist from a [govt in Russia resulting in airstrikes.](https://imgur.com/pol-helps-coordinate-airstrike-on-moderate-syrian-rebels-N7DwWP1)

- [A video detailing the events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR6epSP_Xlw)

  - In 2016, during the complex Syrian Civil War, various rebel groups—some with good intentions and others with nefarious motives—sought to overthrow President Assad. The chaos allowed terrorist groups to flourish, prompting intervention from the United States and Russia, with the former supporting rebels and the latter aiding Assad. An anonymous user on 4chan's Syria General board (SG) claimed that a Syrian rebel group, Jaysh al-Izza, posted a video on YouTube revealing their secret encampment. The group, linked to Al-Qaeda, was seen by 4chan users as a target. A notable 4chan user, Ivan Sirenko, who had connections with the Russian military, received the coordinates from the 4chan community and tweeted them to the Russian Ministry of Defense. This led to an airstrike on the encampment. Two months later, the same rebel group posted another video showing a new training camp. 4chan users once again pinpointed the location using landmarks seen in the video. After thorough verification, they sent the coordinates to Ivan, who facilitated another Russian airstrike.

UPDATE: Turns out it was a really complex war the 4chan got involved in, still keeping this up as a key example however; the main issue is that they exposed their training locations with geographic locations to the internet like complete morons.
Thus bad opsec.

## In 2017, Shia LaBeouf had a protest due to Trumps election; this resulted in a basket weaving image board using OSINT and [sky patterns to figure out where a flag is.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4chan-does-first-good-thing-pulls-off-the-heist-of-the-century1/)

- In 2017, 4chan users managed to track down and replace Shia LaBeouf's "He Will Not Divide Us" protest flag. Using only the live-stream footage of the flag, they analyzed flight patterns, star positions, and a tweet to locate the flag in Greeneville, Tennessee. A local troll then honked his car horn until the sound was picked up on the live-stream, pinpointing the exact location. The flag was replaced with a Trump hat, marking the end of this elaborate trolling operation.

## Digital profiling (OSINT profiling). 

Digital profiling and behavioral analysis are powerful techniques for understanding individuals based on their online activities and digital footprints. While these methods are often used by professionals, you can apply many of the same principles and processes yourself by following a structured approach.

## Closed Sourced Info

- [HUMINT](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/blob/main/HUMINT.md)

**HUMINT can be collected overtly (e.g., interviews, debriefings, diplomatic reporting) or covertly (e.g., espionage, clandestine surveillance).**

**Buying from databrokers can be closed sourced if the info isn't freely available IF not cross referenced VIA the [Curated Lists](#curated-lists)**

### **Key Insights & Pro Tips**

1. **False Positives**:  
   - **Sherlock/Holehe**: Imgur often returns misleading results—verify manually.  
   - **Facecheck.ID**: Extracts links but doesn’t analyze images; cross-reference with [Pimeyes (10 searches)](https://pimeyes.com/en) or others listed on 6.  

2. **GUI vs. CLI**:  
   - **CLI Tools (Blackbird, Sherlock, Maigret)**: Faster but require technical familiarity.  
   - **GUI Wrappers (Crow, No-Shit-Sherlock)**: Easier for beginners; same backend logic.  

3. **Email Investigations**:  
   - Combine **Holehe** (account detection) + **Hudson Rock Extractor** (breach data) for thorough checks; see [**Toolchain Recommendations**](#Toolchain-Recommendations).  
   - For Gmail-specific OSINT, use **GHunt** (via OSINT Rocks).  

4. **Geolocation**:  
   - Use **Google Maps Street View** to verify addresses/landmarks from other tools (e.g., ClustrMaps).  

5. **OPSEC Notes**:  
   - **Rate Limits**: Tools like Google-FU may trigger blocks—use proxies/VPNs.  
   - **Legality**: Avoid scraping private data (e.g., Facebook pro) without consent.  

6. **Biometric Analysis**: You can supplement your biometric analytics with these tools by extracting the results from:
 - faceonlive.com (3 or 4 search limit, may need TOR)
 - lenso.ai 

After that open image in new tab and save or drag it into facecheck.id and compare (as mentioned earlier on step 1)

---

### **Toolchain Recommendations**
- **Quick Username Search**: Crow (GUI for indepth) → Maigret (GUI for indepth) → Sherlock (CLI for depth).  
- **Email Breaches**: Have I Been Pwned → Pentester (freeish) → OSINT Rocks (Hudson Rock/Holehe) → LOLArchiver.  
- **Images**: Facecheck.ID → Pimeyes → lenso.ai → faceonlive  
- **Files**: Encrypted drives (LUKS) → veracrypt → keepassxc

Note on Pentester: Pentester can provide free results on usernames, etc but on a time limit, not worth to buy a service if you're smart and keep records (snapshot).

Note: For keepassxc it's a good idea to use a strong password or a YubiKey (hardware password/security key)
you may also create an additonal database, one that has the password you can remember; the other that has the generated database password for sensitive files.

For niche tools, refer to the [Curated Lists](#curated-lists) section.

Pipeline discussed [here](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/blob/main/opsec.md#opsec-pipeline-for-secure-files)
    
## People search tools (in the states):

**DISCLAIMER: Most of the email info found on these sites appear to be from a databrech from long ago; subjects on these sites can and possibly will still use their email found on these sites as people will rarely change email providers due to TFA + password managers unless if the email itself has been compromised in any way, shape, or form OR if they've changed emails due to harrasment, spam, etc etc.**

### **Key Observations**:
1. **Free vs. Paid**: Most tools offer basic info for free but upsell detailed reports (e.g., PublicRecords → Intelius).  
2. **Data Sources**: Many pull from the same breaches/public records (emails/phones often outdated but still in use).  
3. **Specializations**:  
   - *Social Media*: PeekYou, IDCrawl.  
   - *Geolocation*: ClustrMaps.  
   - *Comprehensive*: FastPeopleSearch, Nuwber, fastbackgroundcheck.  

**Disclaimer**: Accuracy varies; users rarely update emails unless compromised. Use ethically!

### **Pro Tips & Workarounds**

1. **Facebook Private Accounts**:
   - Method 1: Create a fake account (difficult due to Facebook's verification)
   - Method 2: Use browser's *Inspect Element* → *Device Simulator* (or mobile phone) + direct URL
   - Always try logged out or in private mode first

2. **LinkedIn Limitations**:
   - If profiles don't load:
     - Wait 1-2 minutes (cookie/IP rotation)
     - Create a basic account (avoid looking suspicious)
   - HWID/IP tracking may block repeated searches

3. **Twitter Alternatives**:
   - Use **Nitter**/**Xcancel** to avoid rate limits/tracking
   - **Sotwe** work without login

4. **Instagram**:
   - **Dumpor** bypasses some privacy settings
   - **Quick Use** https://dumpor.io/v/USERNAME replace ``USERNAME`` with the user you are trying to see
   - **Will not work with private accounts**

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Anonymity**: Tools like Nitter/Dumpor avoid platform tracking
- **Mobile Tricks**: Simulating mobile devices often works better for restricted content
- **Persistence**: Some platforms (LinkedIn/Facebook) require patience or account creation

## Curated lists

- [Awesome OSINT](https://github.com/jivoi/awesome-osint) - a curated list of OSINT tools, blogs, and videos

- [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/) - a larger list of tools
  
- [OSINT Resources](https://sizeof.cat/post/osint-resources/) - Collection of OSINT resources that seems to be more up to date (includes NSFW)

  - [Archive](https://archive.ph/rZZf0) 

- A whole reddit wiki from the [OSINT community](https://www.reddit.com/r/OSINT/wiki/index/)

- A list of social media, maps, domains, etc also listed [in cipher387's OSINT collection](https://github.com/cipher387/osint_stuff_tool_collection). 

**OPT OUT**

- A whole [big ass list](https://github.com/yaelwrites/Big-Ass-Data-Broker-Opt-Out-List) to opt out and to compare info.

- [inteltechniques opt out workbook](https://inteltechniques.com/workbook.html)

- [Results about you (google index)](https://myactivity.google.com/results-about-you) - check with these results inside the list above for **OPT-OUT**

## Toolchain (self-OSINT):

Google dorks: `https://www.google.com/search?q= "first+last" "Street Address" "City state" "age"` -> [Results about you (google index)](https://myactivity.google.com/results-about-you) -> [big ass list](https://github.com/yaelwrites/Big-Ass-Data-Broker-Opt-Out-List) -> [inteltechniques opt out workbook](https://inteltechniques.com/workbook.html) -> [People Search tools](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#people-search-tools-in-the-states)

**Notice** 

[Results about you (google index)](https://myactivity.google.com/results-about-you) can also be emailed so keep that in mind when comparing info I.E.: Google will find webistes containing your first-last name and address and will ask to remove it from the index. Before applying the removal process on google search be sure to remove info from the website itself that it's hosted on. Google Dorking seems to be a bit quicker and preemptive on removing info about yourself after you visit said sites.

Also with doing google dorks the manual way is that you won't get flagged by google itself as a bot.

## Archive tools that I've made
 
- [link extractor and archive](https://github.com/airborne-commando/link-extractor-and-archive) uses archive.ph - useful on basic webpages. Requires manual intervention (text edits FIND+REPLACE).
