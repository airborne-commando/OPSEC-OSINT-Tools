## Why?

People trust the internet too much. In today’s world, online and offline are practically the same—truth and fiction blur. This README exists to raise awareness. Clone it, fork it, remix it, or even turn it into a [Rentry](https://rentry.co/) page. Spread the knowledge however you like.

Also this guide can help prevent issues such as doxing. The obvious way is to follow [Key-Takeaways](#Key-Takeaways) and use [people search tools](#people-search-tools-in-the-states) with a self audit to reduce the amount of info you have on yourself publicly[^66][^50].

Can you predict someone’s behavior with this? not exactly; people are unpredictable at times.

# OSINT/OPSEC Tools

A list of OSINT/OPSEC tools I made, forked, and/or use.

If you want some quick methodology I suggest you read this [markdown](./markdown/methodology.md).

## Key points

## Notable Examples of Bad Tor OPSEC

- **School Bomb Threats**
    - Harvard’s Eldo Kim[^22] identified for using Tor on school network as the only user and admitting guilt.
- **Silk Road Case**
    - Ross Ulbricht[^5] linked to Silk Road by using his real name/email, posting about Tor, and failing to hide server IPs. The laptop was basically seized according to the FBI.

> "On Oct. 1, 2013, an F.B.I. operation in a public library in San Francisco ended with the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, who was the brain behind Silk Road... At that moment, another agent took the open laptop while logged into the Silk Road administrator's panel" (Oliyaee, 2024, para. 2).[^60]

>"ULBRICHT created Silk Road in January 2011, and owned and operated the underground website until it was shut down by law enforcement authorities in October 2013" <br>(U.S. Department of Justice, 2015, para. 1).[^5]

>"The FBI arrested Ulbricht and seized his laptop on October 1, 2013. A judge sentenced Ulbricht to life in prison for drug trafficking, computer hacking, and money laundering in 2015" (FBI, n.d., para. 2).[^59]

>"In 2015, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison but was pardoned in 2025" (Reiff, 2025, para. 3).[^61]

Ross was pardoned[^62] in 2025 by the trump administration.

- **LulzSec Hacking Group**
    - Members exposed themselves by discussing ops in public IRC[^56][^58][^21][^20], revealing personal info, using stolen cards[^57] to home addresses, and trusting informants.<br>

>"Spitler admitted to communicating during the data breach with his co-defendant, Andrew Auernheimer, 25, who was arrested January 18, 2011, in Fayetteville, Ark., while appearing in state court on unrelated drug charges. The two wrote each other during the breach using Internet Relay Chat, an Internet instant messaging program. Those chats included discussions between Spitler, Auernheimer, and other Goatse Security members about the best way to take advantage of the breach and associated theft" <br>(Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2012).[^57]

- **General Bad OPSEC Practices**
    - Poor compartmentalization, leaking sensitive info, predictable naming, traceable work hours, and unsecured servers.
- **Mullvad VPN: Security Contrast**[^2] [^3]
    - Features: anonymous accounts, strong encryption, no-logs, lockdown mode, DNS blockers, open-source, accepts Monero/cash and is independently audited[^64][^65][^63].
    - **Caution:** No tool is foolproof; human error remains the weakest link.


## Digital Profiling and Behavioral Analysis Guide

- **Understand the Basics**
    - Digital profiling gathers and analyzes online data; behavioral analysis infers motives, habits, and future actions.
- **Collect Digital Biographical Information**
    - Gather identifiers, track online activity, search for recurring usernames, document findings.
- **Analyze Behavioral Patterns**
    - Look for posting times, topics, language, interaction style, preferred platforms, and social networks.
- **Examples**
    - Use AI tools to analyze old posts for recurring interests; tools like Blackbird/Maigret help track usernames across platforms.
- **Assess Competencies and Affinities**
    - Evaluate technical skill, privacy awareness, sociability, and domain expertise.
- **Use Analytical Tools**
    - Employ search engines, data aggregators, visualization/statistics tools and Natural Language Processing (NLPs) for deeper analysis.
- **Iterate and Refine**
    - Continuously update the profile as new data emerges; use structured documentation.
- **Ethical and Legal Considerations**
    - Only use legally accessible data; respect privacy and avoid harassment.
- **Defending Against OSINT Profiling**
    - Practice good OPSEC, use disinformation, audit yourself, and set profiles to private.


## Real-World OSINT and OPSEC Examples

**Criminals**
*Sony Pictures Hack (2014):* Used OSINT on staff and infrastructure for phishing and breach.[^68]
>"Email notifications sent via accounts like designedcuratedamy58[@]gmail.com alerted operators whenever targets began assessments or ran malicious curl commands" (Priya, 2025, para. 14).[^69]

**Ashley Madison Breach (2015):** Used **CSINT** to leak sensitive user data, causing blackmail and public exposure.

>“When the company balked, the group published personal information about 36 million users. That’s a lot of very personal information of a lot of people” (Schifferle, 2016, para. 5).[^25]

**Civilians**
    - *Identifying Russian Soldiers:* Used facial recognition and open-source images to ID participants in conflicts.[^55]
    - *Cameroon Investigation:* Used metadata and geolocation to verify military abuses.[^23]

**Law Enforcement**
    - *Tracking Stolen Property:* Monitored online marketplaces to recover stolen goods.[^24]
    - *ShadowDragon’s SocialNet:* Mapped social networks from 200+ sources to aid investigations.[^4]

**OPSEC Failures**
    - *Guccifer 2.0:* Forgot to activate VPN, exposing real IP and identity.[^3]
    - *Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht:* Used personal email and left digital traces, leading to arrest.[^5]

## (Operations Security) is a systematic process for:
1. Identifying[^33]
2. Protecting and controlling critical information[^33][^34]

It's a security discipline and operations function that involves a continuous cycle of:
* Identifying critical information and indicators (CII)
  * Critical information and indicators are essential components of Operations Security aimed at protecting sensitive data that could be exploited by adversaries. Critical Information includes unclassified or controlled unclassified information about activities, intentions, capabilities, or limitations that adversaries can use to gain an advantage. Indicators are observable actions or pieces of information that reveal critical details about operations, such as sudden changes in procedures or increased security measures. Protecting this information involves identifying vulnerabilities and implementing countermeasures to prevent unauthorized disclosure
* Analyzing potential threats and vulnerabilities
* Assessing risks
* Developing countermeasures to protect CII

 is used to protect information and activities from adversaries. It helps identify and protect sensitive information that could give an adversary an advantage. OPSEC principles can be applied in daily life, such as not sharing personal information like a DOB, street address, email, phone number.

**Examples of OPSEC mistakes include:**
* Over-sharing personal information online

   * Chris Chan:<br>
     has a huge digital footprint and is easily fooled by trolls online.[^40][^41][^42"]

* suspectAGB: as stated by the BBC.
>"Tariq Monteiro, 23, and Siyad Mohamud, 24, were part of a group which targeted Alex Smith over a gang-based feud as he left a restaurant near Euston station on 12 August 2019. The pair fled to Kenya immediately after the incident and were arrested in Nairobi last year. They both refused to appear for their sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey. Monteiro, of no fixed address, was ordered to serve a minimum of 24 years in prison, while Mohamud, of Barker Drive, Camden, will serve at least 23 years." (Evans 2023, para. 1–4)[^44]

He shared a kitchen photo and people were able to deduce where he was due to an appliance. As stated by bugzorc opsecfail

>"Observant individuals quickly pinpointed his location, thanks to telltale signs like common household plugs and the typical kitchen setup. Moreover, the metadata of his posts gave him away." <br>(bugzorc 2025, para. 1)[^43]

* Leaving unused social media online

**Interaction/elicitation:** 

Interacting with a target on social media has been shown to compromise anonymity, as noted by opsecfail. For instance, w0rmer uploaded a photo of his girlfriend that still contained GPS Exif data, which ultimately led investigators to her. When questioned, she admitted he had asked her to take the picture.<br>(bugzorc 2025, para. 3; opsecfail.github.io/blog.html?filecase=w0rmer)[^45]

Similarly, w0rmer himself explained in an interview that he often provoked people online and had a deliberate process for cleaning photos of metadata. However, during one publishing slip, he accidentally uploaded the wrong image that contained Exif data, which gave authorities critical information. <br>(“W0rmer – Darknet Diaries” 2020, 00:25:58–00:26:41; darknetdiaries.com/transcript/63)[^46]

OPSEC supplements other security disciplines rather than replacing them.

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Messaging**:  
   - **Signal** OR **Simplex** > **Telegram** for privacy.[^30][^31][^32]

   - Remember: E2E ≠ total anonymity (metadata leaks/habits matter)[^45][^46][^8][^43].


2. **Anonymity**:  
   - **Tor** + **Mullvad VPN** + **XMR** = layered protection.  
   - Avoid logging into personal accounts while using these tools.
   - Pitfalls: you need to use TOR and Mullvad separately for maximum Anonymity, use a [Virtual Machine](./markdown/opsec.md#virtualization) for VPN's and TOR on another (or the host).

3. **Identity**:  
   - **Unique usernames** + **AI faces** + **word spinning** = harder to trace.  

4. **Self-Audit**:  
   - Regularly **opt out** of data brokers and **[OSINT yourself](#toolchain-self-osint)**.  

5. **OPSEC Mindset**:  
   - Follow **[good OPSEC](./markdown/good-opsec.md)** and avoid **[bad habits](./markdown/badopsec.md)**.


**Note**:

By TOR I mean Tor Browser, VPN as in Virtual Private Network, and by Virtual Private Network I mean by Virtual Private Network Service - IE: Mullvad (though it can be other types of VPN's out there as long as it's safe to use and vetted by privacy experts). XMR is Monero Coin or Monero for short, a Privacy Coin.

Check Wikipedia or the sources cited If you're confused on all of these here:
1. VPN service[^9][^10], what we're gonna use here.
2. TOR, What should be used separately.[^12][^11][^13]
3. XMR, for VPN's that take XMR as payment.[^14]

### **Pro Tips**
- **Monero Mining**: Run a local node to avoid centralized exchanges tracing purchases.[^15]

## disinformation

Disinformation[^16][^17] in the context of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) refers to deliberate actions taken to obscure, mislead, or mask the true activities, intentions, or identities of individuals or organizations from those conducting open-source intelligence gathering. [here](./markdown/disinformation.md).

## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

**<div align="center">What is it, how is this used and why is it important:</div>**

- OSINT is the practice of collecting and analyzing information from public sources to address specific intelligence needs. OSINT is used by government agencies and commercial organizations for various purposes, including:

  - Reconnaissance
  - Cyber crime investigations
  - Market trend analysis
  - Brand positioning analysis
  - Measuring risk to an organization
  - Understanding the actor, tactics, and targets
  - Gather real-time information
  - Make informed decisions
  - Receive early warnings of potential threats

## Who uses Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)?

- National Security and Intelligence Agencies, Law Enforcement, Businesses, Cybersecurity and Cyber-crime Groups, Privacy-Conscious People, Non-Governmental Organizations

  - The CIA[^27], Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)[^26], and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) all use OSINT[^1].
  - OSINT can protect citizens (private or otherwise) from identity theft, sexual violence, and abuse[^52][^53].
  - OSINT can monitor competitors, investigate new markets, and plan marketing activities[^51].
  - OSINT can gather intelligence about specific targets online.
  - OSINT can check how outsiders can break into their computing devices.[^49]
  - OSINT can be used on oneself to secure privacy.[^50]
  - Bellingcat[^48] and the Center for Information Resilience[^47] use OSINT.
  - And you! Yes, you can use OSINT.

## Sources of OSINT
OSINT can gather information from various sources, including:
- Public government data as stated by the University of North Texas Libraries[^35].

Public data is data that is used, reused and or redistributed. Government entities operating at various judicial levels such as local, state, federal, and the international levels. This creates various amounts of public data, which is accessible without restrictions. Terms of use must be agreed to or approved depending on consideration before accessing these datasets and or records, such as Heath (HIPPA) and or Educational Data.

Such can include for example [casesearch](https://ujsportal.pacourts.us/casesearch) in Pennsylvania Courts; landlord, criminal, civil et al should have an address as that's public govt info. 

A Parcel search for [tax history](https://public.eriecountypa.gov/property-tax-records/property-records/property-tax-search/search-by-parcel.aspx).

An official [Justice site](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/ls/state) listing all states and their local judicial. Case search should be in state judiciary, also for other information such as tax records and property records.

- According to Johns Hopkins University it is. 
    

>“A subfield of publishing which distributes academic research and scholarship” (Shin, 2025)[^67].


- Commercial data:

>"Commercial Data means any and all data and information relating to an identified or identifiable Person (whether the information is accurate or not), alone or in combination with other information, which Person is or was an actual or prospective customer of, or consumer of products offered by, the VS Business or L Brands Business, as applicable. Commercial Data means any and all data collected or otherwise processed by the Seller Entities relating to a customer of the Business" (Law Insider, 2025).[^36]
  
- Grey literature:

>"Grey literature, as defined by the Welch Medical Library, is "information produced on all levels of government, academics, business and industry in electronic and print formats not controlled by commercial publishing i.e. where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body" <br>(Joseph, 2025, paras. 1–2)"[^37].

- genealogical:
  
>"Genealogical research is the tracing of an individual's ancestral history using historical records, both official and unofficial" (University of Maryland Libraries, n.d., para. 1).[^39]

>"Genealogy is the study of families and their ancestors and histories" <br>(Virginia Tech University Libraries, n.d., para. 1).[^38]
  
   - Genealogy: Using family history research and genealogy databases as an intelligence-gathering tool.
   - Death records: Gathering intelligence from records such as death notices, obituaries, gravestone databases, and burial registries.(news papers or local news sites) 

- people search aggregators[^54], typically used in the united states. can give you information on someone such as an email, home address, date of birth, etc.

| `"`                   | Exact phrase                                    | `"confidential file"`         |



**Default Behavior**
- Google treats multiple words as if connected by AND, so results must contain all terms unless you specify otherwise.
- Quotation marks, site:, and filetype: are among the most commonly used explicit operators for more targeted searches.

These operators are not used unless you include them in your query—Google’s default is simply to return results matching all your search terms, ranked by relevance.


### Real world examples of OSINT

## In the year 2016, a basket weaving image board used OSINT to pay some supposed terrorist a visit from a govt in Russia resulting in airstrikes.

>"In 2016, amid the Syrian Civil War, rebel groups tried to overthrow President Assad, leading to foreign involvement from the U.S. and Russia. On 4chan, users identified a rebel camp from a Jaysh al-Izza video and relayed its coordinates to Russian contacts, resulting in airstrikes after the camp was located twice (Pezle, 2022)."[^8][^7]

UPDATE: Turns out it was a really complex war[^19] the 4chan got involved in, still keeping this up as a key example however; the main issue is that they exposed their training locations with geographic locations to the internet like complete morons.
Thus bad opsec.

## In 2017, Shia LaBeouf had a protest due to Trumps election; this resulted in a basket weaving image board using OSINT and [sky patterns to figure out where a flag is.

>"In 2017, 4chan users managed to track down and replace Shia LaBeouf's "He Will Not Divide Us" protest flag. Using only the live-stream footage of the flag, they analyzed flight patterns, star positions, and a tweet to locate the flag in Greeneville, Tennessee. A local troll then honked his car horn until the sound was picked up on the live-stream, pinpointing the exact location. The flag was replaced with a Trump hat, marking the end of this elaborate trolling operation (Lamoureux, Mack 2017)."[^6]

## Digital profiling (OSINT profiling).

Digital profiling and behavioral analysis are powerful techniques for understanding individuals based on their online activities and digital footprints. While these methods are often used by professionals, you can apply many of the same principles and processes yourself by following a structured approach. This creates possible interest and hobbies of an individual.

## Closed Sourced Info

- [HUMINT](./markdown/HUMINT.md)

**HUMINT can be collected overtly (e.g., interviews, debriefings, diplomatic reporting) or covertly (e.g., espionage, clandestine surveillance).**

[Breached Data](#breached-data)

> And remember, closed sourced info can change depending on context. If it came from social media then it's considered open source as it's already out there. If it's from a closed source document like let's say a USB drive then consider it closed source.

See also **[CSINT](./markdown/CSINT.md)**

# IMINT

[IMINT](./markdown/IMINT.md)(Image Intelligence) involves collecting and analyzing visual imagery—satellite, aerial, drone, or ground photos—to extract useful information.[^1][^28]
Contains information such as [SOCMINT](./markdown/IMINT.md#socmint-social-intelligence) and [Reverse Search](./markdown/IMINT.md#reverse-search-google).

GEOINT[^1][^28] is information on geographic locations. Geospatial data may also be called GEOINT data. It's to understand human activity or events and to layer that with data along with geolocations and timing. It has non-military uses as well, example would be for first responders issuing an emergency for a wildfire[^29].

Three examples of GEOINT tools that you can access right now:
- [Earth](https://earth.google.com/web/)
- [Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)
- [bing maps](https://www.bing.com/maps)

### **Key Insights & Pro Tips**

1. **False Positives**:  
   - **Sherlock/Holehe**: Imgur often returns misleading results—verify manually.  
   - **Facecheck.ID**: Extracts links but doesn’t analyze images; cross-reference with [Pimeyes (10 searches)](https://pimeyes.com/en) or others listed on 6.  

2. **GUI vs. CLI**:  
   - **CLI Tools (Blackbird, Sherlock, Maigret)**: requires technical familiarity.  
   - **GUI Wrappers (Crow, No-Shit-Sherlock)**: Easier for beginners; same back-end logic.  

3. **Email Investigations**:  
   - Combine **Holehe** (account detection) + **Hudson Rock Extractor** (breach data) for thorough checks; see [**Toolchain Recommendations**](#Toolchain-Recommendations).  
   - For Gmail-specific OSINT, use **GHunt** (via OSINT Rocks).  
   - Verify a google email, you'll need to be logged in to your own:

            https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=youremail@gmail.com


A post from a linkedin account named Forensic OSINT[^18]:

> "In a clever LinkedIn post, 🔐Yoni  shares a privacy insight and a practical OSINT technique worth bookmarking.
> 
> First, the Gmail dot trick: Google ignores dots in addresses, so variations like davidsmith@gmail[.]com, d.a.v.i.d.s.m.i.t.h[@]gmail[.]com, and david.smith[@]gmail[.]com all route to the same inbox, a fact that’s often misunderstood in email investigations.
> 
> More importantly for OSINT work, Yoni highlights a method to check if an email is linked to a Google account using Google Calendar. Just plug the email into this URL while logged into your own Google account:
> 
> https[:]//calendar[.]google[.]com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=youremail@example[.]com
> 
> If the address is connected to a Google account, the calendar interface loads and displays the bolded email address in the bottom left. If it doesn’t exist, it simply shows “Google Calendar.”
> 
> 🔍 Why It Matters:
> This is a quick, non-intrusive way to validate if an email is active on Google’s ecosystem, especially helpful when vetting aliases, burner accounts, or verifying user identities in investigations (Forensic OSINT, 2025)."

4. **Geolocation**:  
   - Use **Google Maps Street View** to verify addresses/landmarks from other tools (e.g., ClustrMaps).
   - Use birds eye view in [bing maps](https://www.bing.com/maps)
   - use [google earth](https://earth.google.com/web/) for a detailed view.

5. **OPSEC Notes**:  
   - **Rate Limits**: Tools like Google-FU may trigger blocks—use proxies/VPNs.  
   - **Legality**: Avoid scraping private data (e.g., Facebook pro) without consent.  

6. **Bio-metric Analysis**: You can supplement your bio-metric analytics with these tools by extracting the results from:
 - faceonlive.com (3 or 4 search limit, may need TOR)
 - lenso.ai 

After that open image in new tab and save or drag it into facecheck.id and compare (as mentioned earlier on step 1)

---

### **Toolchain Recommendations**
- **Quick Username Search**: Crow (GUI for in-depth) → Maigret (GUI for in-depth) → Sherlock (CLI for depth).  
- **Email Breaches**: Have I Been Pwned → Pentester (freeish) → OSINT Rocks (Hudson Rock/Holehe) → LOLArchiver.  
- **Images**: Facecheck.ID → Pimeyes → lenso.ai → faceonlive  
- **Files**: Encrypted drives (LUKS) → veracrypt → keepassxc

Note on Pentester: Pentester can provide free results on usernames, etc but on a time limit, not worth to buy a service if you're smart and keep records (snapshot).

Note: For keepassxc it's a good idea to use a strong password or a YubiKey (hardware password/security key)
you may also create an additional database, one that has the password you can remember; the other that has the generated database password for sensitive files.

For niche tools, refer to the [Curated Lists](#curated-lists) section.

### **Key Observations**:
1. **Free vs. Paid**: Most tools offer basic info for free but upsell detailed reports (e.g., PublicRecords → Intelius).  
2. **Data Sources**: Many pull from the same breaches/public records (emails/phones often outdated but still in use).  
3. **Specializations**:  
   - *Social Media*: PeekYou, IDCrawl.  
   - *Geo-location*: ClustrMaps.  
   - *Comprehensive*: FastPeopleSearch, Nuwber, fastbackgroundcheck.  

**Disclaimer**: Accuracy varies; users rarely update emails unless compromised. Use ethically!

### **Pro Tips & Workarounds**

1. **Facebook Private Accounts**:
   - Method 1: Create a fake account (difficult due to Facebook's verification)
   - Method 2: Use browser's *Inspect Element* → *Device Simulator* (or mobile phone) + direct URL
   - Always try logged out or in private mode first

2. **LinkedIn Limitations**:
   - If profiles don't load:
     - Wait 1-2 minutes (cookie/IP rotation)
     - Create a basic account (avoid looking suspicious)
   - HWID/IP tracking may block repeated searches

3. **Twitter Alternatives**:
   - Use **Nitter**/**Xcancel**/**Sotwe** to browse anonymously.

4. **Instagram**:
   - **Dumpor** bypasses some privacy settings
   - **Quick Use** https://dumpor.io/v/USERNAME replace ``USERNAME`` with the user you are trying to see
   - **Will not work with private accounts**
   - You may also use https://imginn.com/
       + [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imginn/)
       + [chrome](https://github.com/claromes/socialswitch) make sure to not use picuki, disable tiktok; use a different profile or browser. Can use firefox.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Anonymity**: Tools like Nitter/Dumpor avoid platform tracking
- **Mobile Tricks**: Simulating mobile devices often works better for restricted content
- **Persistence**: Some platforms (LinkedIn/Facebook) require patience or account creation

**Wiki's:**

- A whole reddit wiki from the [OSINT community](https://www.reddit.com/r/OSINT/wiki/index/)

**TOOLKIT:**

- bellingcat [toolkit](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit)

**NEWSLETTER(S):**

- [OSINT news letter](https://osintnewsletter.com) Protip: use "topic" site:https://osintnewsletter.com

example: 

    "facecheck.id" site:https://osintnewsletter.com


**OPT OUTs**

- A whole [big ass list](https://github.com/yaelwrites/Big-Ass-Data-Broker-Opt-Out-List) to opt out and to compare info.

- [inteltechniques opt out workbook](https://inteltechniques.com/workbook.html)

- [Results about you (google index)](https://myactivity.google.com/results-about-you) - Check what google emails you; actually visit the website and see about doing an opt-out there.
  
- [people search tools](#people-search-tools-in-the-states)

## Toolchain (self-OSINT):

Google dorks: 


```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A@{ label: "Google Search Query:<br>'first last' 'Street Address'<br>'City state' 'age'" } --> B["Results about you"]
    B --> C["Big Ass Data Broker Opt Out List"]
    C --> D["IntelTechniques<br>Opt-Out Workbook"]
    D --> E["People Search Tools"]

    A@{ shape: rect}
    click B "https://myactivity.google.com/results-about-you"
    click C "https://github.com/yaelwrites/Big-Ass-Data-Broker-Opt-Out-List"
    click D "https://inteltechniques.com/workbook.html"
```


**Notice** 

[Results about you (google index)](https://myactivity.google.com/results-about-you) can also be emailed so keep that in mind when comparing info from these sources such as: [(OPT OUT)](#people-search-tools-in-the-states), [osint resources](https://sizeof.cat/post/osint-resources/), [osintframework](https://osintframework.com/), [awesome osint](https://github.com/jivoi/awesome-osint?tab=readme-ov-file#-people-investigations), [Internet tools](https://fmhy.xyz/internet-tools#open-source-intelligence), [The Osint Toolbox](https://github.com/The-Osint-Toolbox/People-Search-OSINT), [osint stuff tool collection](https://github.com/cipher387/osint_stuff_tool_collection?tab=readme-ov-file#universal-contact-search-and-leaks-search) Google will find websites containing your first-last name and address and will ask to remove it from the index. Before applying the removal process on google search be sure to remove info from the website itself that it's hosted on. Google Dorking seems to be a bit quicker and preemptive on removing info about yourself after you visit said sites (if applicable).

Also with doing google dorks the manual way is that you won't get flagged by google itself as a bot.
