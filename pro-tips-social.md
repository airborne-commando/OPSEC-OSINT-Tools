Facebook:
For private facebook accounts, you can either use a fake facebook account (difficult due to Zucc's anti-spoofing features) OR use inspect element and simulate a mobile device (or use an actual phone), so long as you have a link to that account or POST.

Linkedin:
Sometimes linkedin will not give you the account, to combat this you'll need to either create an account or wait a minute (cookies probably, could be IP+HW ID's beats me)
