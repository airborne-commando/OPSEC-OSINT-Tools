# OPSEC


- Word spinners

  - [Article spinner, with basic and advanced paraphrase - can only use standard.](https://free-article-spinner.com/)

  - [Another article spinner, no advanced paraphrase; doesn't have different langs](https://www.rewritertools.com/article-spinner)

  - [Article rewriter](https://seotoolstation.com/article-rewriter) this rewriter keeps SEO in mind for search rankings; after a few tries it WILL ask for a login, use TOR to bypass.
 
- Wanna use different langs for free?
 
  - [Use google translate](https://translate.google.com/)

- SEO Tools

  - [Here's a really good site, I'd recommend using TOR browser to bypass the login page after a few tries](https://seotoolstation.com/).

- Face generation

   - [stable-diffusion-webui, use models you can find on the internet; can be used on a local machine](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

      - [Civitai](https://civitai.com/models), I'd personally use 1.5 models under filters for older cards. Don't use inpainting models for image generation.

   - [This person doesn't exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/); a face generator, will have a logo at the bottom of the screen so use

- photo shop tools / photo editing tools

   - [Free inpaint](https://pincel.app/tools/inpaint)

   - [Will downscale the image so you'll probably have to use this after using the tool above](https://www.upscale.media/)

   - [affinity, isn't free](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/)

   - Can also try [GNU gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) but this is barebones
 
   - [Exiftool](https://exiftool.org/), edits metadata on images and can strip them.
      - For Linux users

   Debian:
      
      sudo apt update && sudo apt install exiftool

   Other distros:

   Fedora:

      sudo dnf install exiftool

   Arch:

      sudo pacman -S exiftool

## Spoofing, fake email generation

- Email address + username + name generation
  - [Email user/name generator for cock.li and ProtonMail; useful for non-temp mail service accounts](https://github.com/airborne-commando/user-email-gen)

***DISCLAIMER: Cock.li may be having issues:***

### After:

My fellow r*t*rds: cock.li has not "shut down". You may need to read more than the first line. Anyone suggesting you migrate your account to Gmail, Yahoo, Proton, etc. should not have been using cock.li in the first place. Normal$!gs get off my f*!#ing board. Feel free to migrate, I don't have any good suggestions though. Try that on Proton! PW changes and maybe registration will be back within a couple days.

### Before:

LIBERTY CANARY
Date updated: See the PGP Signed Version Cock.li is in 100% control of all of its hardware, and the service is still operating normally. The website (account registration+pw change) is currently offline. Cock.li will shut down before becoming complicit in crimes against its own user base under duress of any government or organization. Cock.li is not under duress of any government or organization.

I'd probably recommend using something other than cock.li; and use a different email service provider. However, if you decide to use cock.li, you can check out how to enable it in the given link. 

free to check the status of cock.li wth the provided site here https://cock.li/
