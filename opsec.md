# OPSEC


### Word spinners

  - [Article spinner](https://free-article-spinner.com/)
    - with basic and advanced paraphrase - can only use standard.

  - [rewritertools, another article spinner](https://www.rewritertools.com/article-spinner)

    - no advanced paraphrase; doesn't have different langs

  - [Article rewriter](https://seotoolstation.com/article-rewriter)

    - this rewriter keeps SEO in mind for search rankings; after a few tries it WILL ask for a login, use TOR to bypass.
  
  - [chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/)

    -  start with "rewrite this as..." careful of censorship. Doesn't need an account.
  
  - [deepseek](https://chat.deepseek.com/)
    - You'll need an account for deepseek, heavily censored with stuff involving china or sensitive topics (much like gpt); you may download the model from hugging face (not like gpt).
   
    - [Run deepseek offline](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIAssisted/comments/1ibv6g8/how_to_run_deepseek_r1_offline_on_your_computer/), less censorship but IDK about performance.
    - [Archive of reddit post](https://archive.ph/vZXv0)
    - An [aur repo](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lmstudio) for arch users; follow the directions on the reddit post.
    - the offical website of [lmstudio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
 
- Wanna use different langs for free?
 
  - [Use google translate](https://translate.google.com/)

- SEO Tools

  - [seotoolstation](https://seotoolstation.com/) I'd recommend using TOR browser to bypass the login page after a few tries.

### Face generation

   - [stable-diffusion-webui, use models you can find on the internet; can be used on a local machine](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

      - [Civitai](https://civitai.com/models), I'd personally use 1.5 models under filters for older cards. Don't use inpainting models for image generation.

   - [This person doesn't exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/); a face generator, will have a logo at the bottom of the screen so use

### photo shop tools / photo editing tools

## Inpainting tools

   - [Free inpaint](https://pincel.app/tools/inpaint), a free inpainting tool that's on the web

       - Will downscale the image so you'll have to use [upscale](https://www.upscale.media/)
   
   - [IOPaint](https://github.com/Sanster/IOPaint), a free inpainting tool that uses your CPU inside your computer
       - [Linux script](https://github.com/airborne-commando/iopaint-launcher/), use with an alias inside .bashrc or place it inside /usr/bin; check the gist comments.

## Photo editing / stripping

   - [affinity, isn't free](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/)

   - Can also try [GNU gimp](https://www.gimp.org/)
     - this is barebones
 
   - [Exiftool](https://exiftool.org/)
      - edits metadata on images and can strip them.
    
- For Linux users 

   Debian:
      
      sudo apt update && sudo apt install exiftool

   Other distros:

   Fedora:

      sudo dnf install exiftool

   Arch:

      sudo pacman -S exiftool

## Spoofing, fake email generation

- Email address + username + name generation
  - [Email user/name generator for cock.li and ProtonMail; useful for non-temp mail service accounts](https://github.com/airborne-commando/user-email-gen)
 
  - [temp-mail](https://temp-mail.org/en/) an online email generation tool

  - [username gen](https://jimpix.co.uk/words/username-generator.php) an online tool, can enter nothing and get results.

***DISCLAIMER: Cock.li may be having issues:***

### After:

My fellow r*t*rds: cock.li has not "shut down". You may need to read more than the first line. Anyone suggesting you migrate your account to Gmail, Yahoo, Proton, etc. should not have been using cock.li in the first place. Normal$!gs get off my f*!#ing board. Feel free to migrate, I don't have any good suggestions though. Try that on Proton! PW changes and maybe registration will be back within a couple days.

### Before:

LIBERTY CANARY
Date updated: See the PGP Signed Version Cock.li is in 100% control of all of its hardware, and the service is still operating normally. The website (account registration+pw change) is currently offline. Cock.li will shut down before becoming complicit in crimes against its own user base under duress of any government or organization. Cock.li is not under duress of any government or organization.

I'd probably recommend using something other than cock.li; and use a different email service provider. However, if you decide to use cock.li, you can check out how to enable it in the given link. 

free to check the status of cock.li wth the provided site here https://cock.li/

## Virtual Machines

- Virtualization tools

  - [Libvirt](https://virt-manager.org/) For linux users, pretty advanced
  - [vmbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for various platforms

## anonymity tools

  - [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
  - [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en)
  - [tailsOS](https://tails.net/) Runs inside a USB stick.
  - [whonix](www.whonix.org) is an anonymity focused Linux distribution. The operating system consists of two virtual machines, a workstation and a Tor gateway running Debian.



### Secure Methods to Transfer Files in TailsOS

**TailsOS** is designed for privacy and anonymity, so transferring files securely requires careful attention to avoid compromising your security or anonymity. Here are the most secure and recommended methods:

---

**1. Using Encrypted USB Drives**

- Transfer files from your main OS to an encrypted USB stick.
- Boot into Tails, unlock your Persistent Storage, and mount the encrypted USB to access the files.
- This method ensures files are protected by encryption during transfer and storage[3][5][7].

---

**2. OnionShare (Built-In Application)**

- Tails includes OnionShare, which allows you to share files anonymously over the Tor network.
- Open OnionShare from the Applications menu, select the files you want to share, and it will generate an onion link.
- The recipient can use this link (within Tails or any Tor-enabled system) to download the files securely and anonymously[6].

---

**3. Tailscale Taildrop**

- If you use Tailscale, Taildrop enables encrypted peer-to-peer file transfers between your devices.
- Both devices must be running Tailscale and be logged into the same Tailscale account.
- All transfers use end-to-end encryption, and no third-party servers are involved[4].

---

**4. Persistent Storage in Tails**

- Enable Persistent Storage on your Tails USB to securely store files across sessions.
- You can also use tools like VeraCrypt to create additional encrypted containers within Persistent Storage for added security[5][7].

---

**Important Security Considerations**

- Avoid transferring files that could deanonymize you unless absolutely necessary[2][5].
- Never use Tails to transfer files directly to or from another operating system on the same device, as this can compromise your security[5].
- Protect all encryption passphrases carefully and never store them insecurely[7].
- also be sure to wipe all metadata if possible.

## Comparison Table: Secure File Transfer Methods in TailsOS

| Method                 | Encryption | Anonymity | Requires Internet | Notes                         |
|------------------------|------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Encrypted USB Drive    | Yes        | No        | No                | Physical transfer, very safe  |
| OnionShare             | Yes (Tor)  | Yes       | Yes               | Built-in, for sharing with others |
| Tailscale Taildrop     | Yes        | No        | Yes               | Peer-to-peer, personal devices only |
| Persistent Storage     | Yes        | N/A       | No                | For local storage, not transfer |

---

## Summary

- For **local and offline transfers**, use an encrypted USB drive.
- For **anonymous sharing over the internet**, use OnionShare.
- For **secure device-to-device transfers** within your own network, use Tailscale Taildrop.
- Always use Tailsâ€™ Persistent Storage and encryption features to protect sensitive files[5][7].

These methods help ensure your files remain secure and your anonymity is preserved while using TailsOS.

Added true randomness inside the ciphertext with python for faster execution. Feel free to use with [crypt.fyi](https://www.crypt.fyi/new)

On a tangent; sometimes the best opsec is to not interact with the target you're osinting on, for example:

Suzie is thinking Stu is cheating on her with Lexi, so she confronted her with this and more evidence and as a consequence Stu stopped his activity.
Or you're researching about the target with the tools provided but you wanted to gloat about what you found, so now s/he deleted all the info about itself.
