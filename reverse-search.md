**Reverse image search** using tools like **Google Image Search** or **Google Lens** allows you to use an image instead of text to find related information online. Here’s how to use these tools for your specific tasks, as well as what they cannot be used for:

### How to Use Reverse Image Search

You can use Google’s reverse image search on both mobile and desktop:

* **On Mobile:**

  * Open the Google app or go to google.com.
  * Tap the **Google Lens** icon (camera).
  * You can either take a photo or upload one from your device.
  * Adjust the focus area if needed, then view the results.

* **On Desktop:**

  * Go to google.com or images.google.com.
  * Click the **camera icon** (Google Lens).
  * Upload an image, paste an image URL, or drag and drop an image.
  * Results will appear, showing visually similar images and related web pages.

### What You Can Use It For

* **Find an article:** Upload or link to an image (like a screenshot or photo from an article) to locate the original article or similar ones where the image appears.
* **Identify a device name or type:** Take or upload a photo of a device (such as a phone or laptop), and Google Lens will often identify the brand and model (e.g., Samsung, Pixel, Apple).
* **Find a brand, restaurant, or location:** Upload a photo of a logo, storefront, food, or landmark to identify the brand, restaurant, or location. Google Lens is particularly effective at recognizing well-known places and commercial brands.

### What You Cannot Do

* **Reverse search people:** Google’s reverse image search is not intended for identifying or searching for people. It is designed for objects, places, products, and articles—not for facial recognition or finding personal information about individuals.

### Extra Tips

* On mobile browsers, you may need to request the desktop site to access all reverse image search features.
* In Chrome on mobile, you can long-press an image and select “Search Image with Google.”

Reverse image search is a powerful tool for fact-checking, identifying objects or places, and finding the source of images, but it should not be used to search for or identify private individuals.
