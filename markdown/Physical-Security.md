## Physical Security

Physical security typically includes: locks, enforced doors, cameras, security guards. But there is a caveat; it all involves a risk assessment and the self audit of one weaknesses as seen in [Threat Actor](./markdown/expanded-examples/threat-actor.md).

Facilities must maintain secure, climate-controlled environments (50–80°F, 20–80% humidity) with limited flammables. Critical equipment should be physically secured, tracked, and monitored, with special care taken for laptops and portable devices. Electrical safety requires surge protection and proper wiring. Finally, sensitive information must be controlled at all stages, from printing and copying to final secure disposal or transport.(Chapter 5-Protecting Your System: Physical Security, The Institute of Education Sciences)[^pubs98]

With that out of the way... in a civilian example of physical security this would typically include, locks, enforced doors, cameras with again examples you'd see from [Threat Actor](./markdown/expanded-examples/threat-actor.md)
