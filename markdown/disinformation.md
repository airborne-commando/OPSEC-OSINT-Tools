# Disinformation in OSINT

Disinformation in the context of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) refers to deliberate actions taken to obscure, mislead, or mask the true activities, intentions, or identities of individuals or organizations from those conducting open-source intelligence gathering.[^cisa_disinfo]

## **What is a Disinformation?**
* In the digital realm, a "disinformation" involves creating false leads, decoy data, or misleading signals to confuse or distract adversaries, making it harder for them to gather accurate intelligence or track real activities.[^cisa_disinfo]

## **How Does a Disinformation Work in OSINT?**

* **Information Overload:** Flooding open sources with irrelevant, redundant, or misleading information to drown out genuine signals and make analysis more difficult.[^cisa_disinfo]
* **Decoy Accounts and Content:** fabricated or deliberately manipulated audio/visual content. Intentionally created conspiracy theories or rumours. This type of "wrong" information is deliberately shared to harm or deceive a person.[^misinformation][^cisa_disinfo]
* **False Attribution:** Planting data or digital artifacts that point to incorrect actors, locations, or intentions.[^cisa_disinfo]
* **Obfuscation Techniques:** Using anonymization, encryption, or deliberate mislabeling of data to mask true activities.[^cisa_disinfo]

## **Purpose and Use Cases**

| Purpose             | Example in OSINT Context                                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Concealment         | Masking the real identity of an organization or individual online          |
| Misdirection        | Leading OSINT analysts to false conclusions via decoy data                 |
| Protection          | Shielding sensitive operations from adversarial intelligence gathering     |
| Counterintelligence | Detecting and disrupting hostile OSINT activities by feeding false signals |
| Conspiracy theories | Creating conspiracy theories in which there are powerful actors that create important events |

## **Relevance to OSINT Practitioners**

* OSINT analysts must be aware of the possibility of encountering disinformation operations, which can introduce noise, false positives, or misleading narratives into their data sets.
* Effective OSINT requires cross-referencing multiple sources, validating data authenticity, and recognizing patterns that may indicate deliberate obfuscation.

## **Conclusion**

Recognizing and countering such operations is a critical skill for OSINT practitioners, who must distinguish between genuine intelligence and deliberate deception.
