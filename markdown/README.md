# Sub guides
This DIR contains all the other guides that are the essential and or supplemental to the [main guide](../README.md).

This collection provides methodologies, toolkits, real-world examples, and best practices for both defensive security and intelligence gathering.

*   **[Smoke Screen Operations (`smokescreen-misinfo.md`)](./smokescreen-misinfo.md)** - How to obfuscate activities and mislead adversaries conducting OSINT against you.

### Practical Applications & Lessons
*   **[Real-World Examples (`examples.md`)](./examples.md)** - Case studies showing how OSINT and OPSEC failures played out for criminals, civilians, and law enforcement.
*   **[Bad OPSEC Case Studies (`badopsec.md`)](./badopsec.md)** - A collection of famous operational security failures and the lessons learned from them.

### Data Management

## üîÑ The Unified Approach

This repository is built on the principle that effective security (**OPSEC**) and effective intelligence gathering (**OSINT**) are two sides of the same coin. The process is cyclical:

1.  **Threat Model & Self-Audit:** Identify what to protect and analyze your own exposure.
2.  **Profile & Gather Intelligence:** Understand your target or adversary using structured INTs.
3.  **Implement Countermeasures:** Harden your privacy and employ deception (smokescreens).
4.  **Protect & Destroy:** Secure data at rest and ensure its safe disposal.
5.  **Repeat:** Continuously review and adapt your posture.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This information is for **educational and research purposes only**. The techniques and tools described can be used for both ethical security improvement and malicious activities. Always adhere to the following principles:

*   **Legality:** Ensure all your activities comply with local, state, and federal laws.
*   **Ethics:** Do not harass, stalk, or invade the privacy of others.
*   **Authorization:** Only conduct security testing on systems you own or have explicit written permission to test.
