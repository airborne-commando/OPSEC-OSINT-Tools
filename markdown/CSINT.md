## Closed-Source Intelligence (CSINT)

CSINT[^psu][^azdps] refers to "Closed-Source Intelligence." It is the process of collecting and analyzing information from non-public, restricted, or confidential sources. These sources can include classified government documents, proprietary corporate data, internal communications, or data obtained through confidential agreements or intelligence networks. CSINT is used in investigations where sensitive or confidential information is critical, such as in law enforcement, intelligence organizations, corporate security, and private investigations.

CSINT access is typically regulated legally, requiring court orders, warrants, or special permissions, and it involves a structured process of accessing, collecting, and analyzing this restricted information safely and ethically. It provides insights that are often unavailable through public or open sources, making it valuable in cases like criminal investigations, national security, and corporate fraud. Its use is bound by strict legal and ethical considerations to protect privacy and avoid misuse.

"Information sources are categorized as open, closed, and classified. Open source (OSINT) includes publicly available materials like reports, theses, and newsletters, but may be unreliable or biased. Closed source information is restricted data in databases containing personal records or intelligence, with limited access. Classified information, gathered through covert human or technical intelligence, is highly accurate but has strict dissemination controls that can limit practical use."

"Closed source data, because of its origin, is often considered more accurate and reliable" (Pennsylvania State University, 2016)[^psu].

"typically revolves around close-held personnel decisions, upcoming policy announcements that will impact the workforce, or some juicy gossip." (CIA, Sept 19 2024)[^CIA]

"Throughout history, military, religious and community leaders have actively sought individuals with information-gathering skills, basing decisions on intelligence obtained this way. The earliest recognized text on this subject is "The Art of War, The Art of Strategy[^Sunzi][^Tzu]" by Sun Tzu, a 5th century BC Chinese warlord and mercenary. He was acclaimed for commanding successful military operations through effective intelligence gathering and decision-making. This work remains essential reading for military and corporate strategists and intelligence operatives worldwide, demonstrating that deploying information gatherers for military operations is commonplace." As described on page 3 (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2011)[^azdps]

**In historical context for CSINT:**

"All warfare is based on deception" and "As a result, only an enlightened ruler and a wise general will use the army's highest intelligence for spying purposes, achieving great success. Spies are a critical element in water because they determine an army's ability to move." As described on page 3 and 62 (Sun-Tzu on the Art of War, 1910)[^Tzu]

Meaning that [HUMINT](HUMINT.md) is also CSINT, both historically and in the modern world.

In summary:
- CSINT involves collecting confidential, non-public information through methods that may be legal (with proper authority) or illegal (such as hacking), depending on the context.
- It also can come from Human Sources, like an interrogation or an interview.
- Can also be in a civilian setting, such as job interviews or businesses.
- HUMINT and CSINT overlap, but can be separate; it again all depends on the context. Was it a secret operation or an interview?

See [HUMINT](HUMINT.md) and [Main Guide/Breached Data](../README.md#breached-data) as examples. But you need to be aware of rumors.
