## Closed-Source Intelligence (CSINT)

CSINT[^psu][^azdps] refers to "Closed-Source Intelligence." It is the process of collecting and analyzing information from non-public, restricted, or confidential sources. These sources can include classified government documents, proprietary corporate data, internal communications, or data obtained through confidential agreements or intelligence networks. CSINT is used in investigations where sensitive or confidential information is critical, such as in law enforcement, intelligence organizations, corporate security, and private investigations.

CSINT access is typically regulated legally, requiring court orders, warrants, or special permissions, and it involves a structured process of accessing, collecting, and analyzing this restricted information safely and ethically. It provides insights that are often unavailable through public or open sources, making it valuable in cases like criminal investigations, national security, and corporate fraud. Its use is bound by strict legal and ethical considerations to protect privacy and avoid misuse.

"Information sources fall into three main categories: open, closed, and classified. Open source (OSINT) refers to publicly available material, including 'grey literature' such as reports, theses, conference documents, and newsletters. While useful, these may be unreliable, biased, or exaggerated. Closed source information is restricted, often found in structured databases containing personal records, registrations, or intelligence relevant to investigations. Access is generally limited for specific purposes. Classified information, obtained through covert methods like human or technical intelligence, is typically highly accurate and valuable. However, strict dissemination controls can limit its practical use in analytical and operational contexts." As described on page 12 (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2011)

"Closed source data, because of its origin, is often considered more accurate and reliable" (Pennsylvania State University, 2023)[^psu].

"throughout history there have been many examples of military, religious and community leaders actively seeking and or tasking individuals with gathering of information skill sets and then basing their decisions on the information obtained in this way. The earliest and most recognized historical text on the subject of gathering of information and actions based on intelligence is “The Art of War, The Art of Strategy” written by Sun Tzu in the 5th Century Before Christ, a Chinese warlord and a mercenary. He was widely acclaimed and highly honored for his possession, means, and skill to command a series of military operations whose success owed a lot to his effective gathering of information and intelligence-led decision-making. It says much for the characteristic and standard of this work that it still remains in circulation, and it is absolutely necessary; extremely important reading for military and corporate strategists and intelligence operatives worldwide. Throughout Employing gatherers of information for a military operation is something frequently encountered or ordinary." As described on page 3 (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2011)[^azdps]


"All warfare is based on deception" and "As a result, only an enlightened ruler and a wise general will use the army's highest intelligence for spying purposes, achieving great success. Spies are a critical element in water because they determine an army's ability to move." As described on page 3 and 62 (Sun-Tzu on the Art of War, 1910)[^Tzu]

In summary:
- As intelligence, CSINT means collecting confidential, non-public information with legal authority or illegal depending on context such as hacking.
