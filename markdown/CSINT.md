## Closed-Source Intelligence (CSINT)

CSINT[^psu][^azdps] refers to "Closed-Source Intelligence." It is the process of collecting and analyzing information from non-public, restricted, or confidential sources. These sources can include classified government documents, proprietary corporate data, internal communications, or data obtained through confidential agreements or intelligence networks. CSINT is used in investigations where sensitive or confidential information is critical, such as in law enforcement, intelligence organizations, corporate security, and private investigations.

CSINT access is typically regulated legally, requiring court orders, warrants, or special permissions, and it involves a structured process of accessing, collecting, and analyzing this restricted information safely and ethically. It provides insights that are often unavailable through public or open sources, making it valuable in cases like criminal investigations, national security, and corporate fraud. Its use is bound by strict legal and ethical considerations to protect privacy and avoid misuse.

Information sources fall into three main categories: open, closed, and classified. Open source (OSINT) refers to publicly available material, including “grey literature” such as reports, theses, conference documents, and newsletters. While useful, these may be unreliable, biased, or exaggerated. Closed source information is restricted, often found in structured databases containing personal records, registrations, or intelligence relevant to investigations. Access is generally limited for specific purposes. Classified information, obtained through covert methods like human or technical intelligence, is typically highly accurate and valuable. However, strict dissemination controls can limit its practical use in analytical and operational contexts.

"Closed source data, because of its origin, is often considered more accurate and reliable" (Pennsylvania State University, 2023)[^psu].

In summary:
- As intelligence, CSINT means collecting confidential, non-public information with legal authority or illegal depending on context such as hacking.
