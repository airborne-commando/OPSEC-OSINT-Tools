# Here's a list of good operational security (OPSEC) practices for the average person, along with real-world examples:

See: [badopsec](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/blob/main/badopsec.md) for advice on good opsec, can't have good opsec without bad opsec examples.

Below are for the normies out there.

## Use Strong, Unique Passwords

- Create complex passwords for each account
- Utilize a password manager to keep track of them
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Use different usernames inside a password manager

**Example:** John uses a password manager to generate and store unique 20-character passwords for each of his online accounts, including his email, social media, and banking websites.

## Keep Software Updated

- Regularly update operating systems, applications, and antivirus software
- Enable automatic updates when possible

**Example:** Sarah sets her smartphone to automatically install security updates overnight, ensuring she always has the latest protections.

## Be Cautious with Personal Information

- Limit the personal details shared on social media
- Be wary of phishing attempts via email or phone
- [self OSINT](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#toolchain-self-osint)

**Example:** Mike avoids posting his exact birth date, home address, or vacation plans on Facebook to reduce the risk of identity theft or home burglary.

## Secure Physical Devices

- Use screen locks on all devices
- Never leave devices unattended in public places
- for SSD's, encrypt drives if storing DoD (Do or Die) data. [Toolchain discussed here](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#toolchain-recommendations)

**Example:** Lisa always activates her laptop's screen lock when stepping away, even for a quick coffee break at the office.

## Use Secure Networks

- Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions
- Use a VPN when connecting to unfamiliar networks

**Example:** Tom uses his smartphone's cellular data instead of the free airport Wi-Fi when checking his bank account while traveling.

## Practice Email Security

- Be cautious of unexpected attachments or links
- Verify the sender's identity before responding to requests for sensitive information
- Be mindful of what is out there, see [people search tools](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#people-search-tools-in-the-states) and [self OSINT](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#toolchain-self-osint)

**Example:** Emma receives an urgent email claiming to be from her bank. Instead of clicking the provided link, she calls the bank directly using their official phone number to verify the request.

## Implement Home Network Security

- Use a strong password for your Wi-Fi network
- Make sure your network is up to date and not using outdated routers

**Example:** The Johnson family changes their Wi-Fi password every six months and ensures their router's firmware is always up-to-date.

## Be Mindful of Physical Documents

- Shred sensitive documents before disposal
- Secure important papers in a locked safe or filing cabinet
- practice [physical destruction](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/blob/main/physical-destruction.md)

**Example:** David always shreds credit card offers and old bank statements before putting them in the recycling bin.

## Use Privacy Settings on Social Media

- Regularly review and adjust privacy settings on all platforms
- Be selective about friend requests and connections
- Be mindful of re-using usernames on different sites, see [Digital Profiling examples](https://github.com/airborne-commando/OPSEC-OSINT-Tools/blob/main/Digital-Profiling.md#31-Examples) 

**Example:** Rachel sets her Instagram account to private and carefully vets new follower requests to control who can see her posts.

## Be Cautious with Third-Party Apps

- Only download apps from official stores (google, apple)
- Review app permissions before installing

**Example:** Mark carefully reads the permissions requested by a new game app and decides not to install it when he sees it wants access to his contacts and location data.

## Practice physical security if you're really paranoid

- Buy a camera
- Get a permit to own a firearm, and practice
- Get chemical weapons

**Example:** Sarah feels unsafe in her neighborhood so she decided to get a camera and a permit for a pistol for home defense, also bought pepper spray to carry on her person.

By implementing these OPSEC practices, the average person can significantly improve their personal and digital security in everyday life.
