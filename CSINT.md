## Closed-Source Intelligence (CSINT)

CSINT refers to "Closed-Source Intelligence." It is the process of collecting and analyzing information from non-public, restricted, or confidential sources. These sources can include classified government documents, proprietary corporate data, internal communications, or data obtained through confidential agreements or intelligence networks. CSINT is used in investigations where sensitive or confidential information is critical, such as in law enforcement, intelligence organizations, corporate security, and private investigations.

CSINT access is typically regulated legally, requiring court orders, warrants, or special permissions, and it involves a structured process of accessing, collecting, and analyzing this restricted information safely and ethically. It provides insights that are often unavailable through public or open sources, making it valuable in cases like criminal investigations, national security, and corporate fraud. Its use is bound by strict legal and ethical considerations to protect privacy and avoid misuse.

Additionally, CSINT can refer to the "Center for Security, Innovation and New Technology" at American University, which conducts research and policy work on security issues related to emerging digital technologies and their geopolitical and societal impacts.

In summary:
- As intelligence, CSINT means collecting confidential, non-public information with legal authority.
- As an organization, CSINT is a research center focused on security and innovation in technology.
