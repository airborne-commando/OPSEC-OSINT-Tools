Tor is a powerful tool for online anonymity, but it's not foolproof. Several cases demonstrate how poor operational security (OPSEC) can lead to the unmasking of Tor users, even when engaging in illegal activities. Here are some notable examples of bad Tor OPSEC:

## School Bomb Threats

### Florida High School Student

A high school student in Florida used Tor to access a dark web marketplace and purchase bomb threat services. His OPSEC failures included:

1. Bragging about his actions to friends
2. Repeating the offense multiple times
3. Leaving evidence of dark web access on his phone
4. Confessing to the police when confronted

### Harvard Student Eldo Kim

Eldo Kim, a Harvard student, emailed bomb threats over Tor to avoid taking exams. His OPSEC mistakes were:

1. Using the school network to access Tor
2. Being the only Tor user on the network at the time of the threat
3. Admitting to the crime when questioned by police

## Silk Road Case

Ross Ulbricht, alleged operator of the Silk Road dark web marketplace, made several OPSEC blunders:

1. Using his real name email ([email protected]) in forum posts seeking IT help
2. Posting on Stack Overflow about Tor hidden services under a username later linked to Silk Road
3. Mentioning Tor and Silk Road to customs officials when caught with fake IDs
4. Failing to protect the real IP address of Silk Road servers

## LulzSec Hacking Group

Members of the LulzSec hacking group made various OPSEC mistakes:

1. Discussing operational activities in IRC channels
2. Revealing personal information, allowing profiling
3. Using stolen credit cards for purchases shipped to their own addresses
4. Trusting individuals who were working with the FBI

## General Bad OPSEC Practices

Other examples of poor OPSEC when using Tor include:

1. Contaminating identities by not maintaining compartmentalization
2. Failing to keep sensitive information confidential
3. Using predictable naming conventions for usernames, code, and passwords
4. Maintaining consistent working hours that can be traced to a specific time zone
5. Leaving command-and-control servers unsecured, exposing sensitive data

These cases highlight the importance of maintaining strict OPSEC practices, even when using anonymity tools like Tor. Simple mistakes and oversights can lead to the exposure of one's identity and activities.
